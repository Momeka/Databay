Run to Databay was created for the 4th GBjam (http://gbjam.net/) and
was developed using GBDK.
I've decided to release the source code of Databay for educational purposes,
since resources for GBDK are getting pretty thin these days and other
people's source codes was what I learned the most from.

For more GBDK resources I'll advice you to check out 
GBDK-developers: http://gbdk-developers.com/

If you got any question, feedback or anything else feel free to 
contact me.
